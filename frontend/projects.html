            <h3>Enhanced Prototype for Security and Health Purpose Using IoT</h3>
            <p>This project aims to create a wristwatch-type prototype that continuously monitors health parameters. It
                will automatically assess any changes in the user's body conditions and report them to the respective
                authorities along with the user's location.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This prototype utilizes various sensors to monitor parameters such as heart rate, body temperature, and
                blood pressure. If any abnormal conditions are detected, the device will send alerts to the concerned
                department, ensuring timely medical assistance.</p>

            <h4>Project Structure</h4>
            <p><strong>Components:</strong> The project uses an Arduino microcontroller along with a GPS tracker, pulse
                meter, temperature sensor, and blood pressure monitor.</p>

            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time health monitoring</li>
                <li>Automatic alert system for emergencies</li>
                <li>Location tracking via GPS</li>
                <li>Integration with GSM for sending alerts</li>
                <li>Customizable alert thresholds based on user needs</li>
                <li>User-friendly interface for data visualization</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Challenges and Future Work</h4>
            <p>Challenges include ensuring accurate sensor readings and minimizing false alerts. Future improvements
                could involve integrating more health parameters, enhancing the user interface for better interaction,
                and implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive health monitoring.</p>

            <h4>Important Notice</h4>
            <p>This project is based on IoT development, utilizing hardware like the <strong>ESP8266</strong>. The
                project involves various libraries with deep directory structures that are critical for its operation.
                However, due to operating system limitations, particularly on Windows, where the maximum file path
                length is 260 characters, I have not uploaded the project to GitHub. All files and project resources are
                stored locally on my system.</p>

            <h4>License</h4>
            <p>This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.</p>

            <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
            <p>Thanks to the open-source community for the libraries and tools used in this project.</p>
