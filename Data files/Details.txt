Genesys - Contribution and Learning

Contribution: I worked as an Associate Software Engineer in Test (SDET) at Genesys, where I was primarily responsible for automating testing scenarios across API, UI, and End-to-End testing. I took full ownership of assigned epics or features, from understanding them to developing automation stories and scenarios using Java with the TestNG framework. I actively contributed to the stability and functionality of key modules, including the Speech To Text feature, while also providing innovative ideas to optimize the product for both the organization and clients. Additionally, I developed several internal web applications to enhance efficiency and reduce workload across the testing teams.

Learning: Through this role, I gained deep expertise in building testing frameworks from scratch to accommodate complex features. I honed my skills in various testing methodologies, including API, UI, and End-to-End testing, while learning to manage the entire test lifecycle independently. I also learned and implemented Java design patterns for better optimization and understanding, which enhanced my approach to software development and testing. Working on multiple feature deployments taught me to balance innovation with stability, continuously improving both the product and my technical skills.

Accenture - Contribution and Learning

Contribution: At Accenture, I worked as an Associate Software Engineer within the Integrated Web Application Testing team. My primary responsibilities involved understanding and following the testing process from Test Planning to Test Case Design, and end-to-end test execution. I contributed significantly to automating the testing process using Selenium with Java. I actively engaged in system, integration, and regression testing to ensure consistent updates and functionality even after the product went live. Additionally, I provided valuable input into the design of various test cases and resolved multiple functional issues that arose in the applications.

Learning: During my time at Accenture, I strengthened my skills in testing methodologies, including system, integration, and regression testing. I learned how to effectively contribute to test automation and applied my knowledge of Selenium with Java in real-world scenarios. Completing the tester training within the top 10 and earning a spot on the Wall of Fame was a significant achievement, further solidifying my foundational expertise in software testing and continuous improvement.
